# Commodore disk drives

## Background

A place to file some of my simple code experiments. With the aim to better understand the 1541/1571/1581 disk drives and commodore file types etc.

**1571 C64 test**

Testing a 1571 with just a C64 can be a bit confusing without reference to the user guide. 
Especially as the 1571 defaults to 1541 mode. You could quite easily miss the second head test.
This simple code runs through a few tests to check both heads and 1541 and 1571 modes.
